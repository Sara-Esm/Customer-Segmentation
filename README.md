# Customer-Segmentation
In todayâ€™s fast-paced business environment, companies strive to enhance customer satisfaction by leveraging new technologies and services. However, maintaining personalized interactions with each customer becomes increasingly challenging and impractical. This is where the concept of Customer Segmentation comes into play.

What is Customer Segmentation?
Customer Segmentation involves categorizing customers based on shared characteristics, behavior, and needs. This strategic approach offers invaluable insights that enable companies to tailor their products and services to specific customer segments. By understanding the unique attributes of each segment, businesses can optimize product features, target marketing efforts more effectively, and ultimately elevate their overall market value.

Project Overview
